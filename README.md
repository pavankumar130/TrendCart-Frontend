# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# About The Project
TrendCart is a dynamic and user-friendly e-commerce website that offers a wide range of products to its customers. Powered by a robust backend, the platform utilizes various packages like "bcryptjs" for secure password encryption, "cloudinary" for efficient image management, and "stripe" for smooth and secure payment transactions.

The frontend of TrendCart is built using cutting-edge technologies such as React for seamless user interactions, while "react-redux" ensures smooth state management. The website's attractive design is enriched by components from "@headlessui/react" and "@heroicons/react," providing an engaging and intuitive user experience.

TrendCart allows admins to easily manage the inventory by adding products, specifying their brand, size, color, and category. To protect sensitive actions and data, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for token-based authentication and verification, ensuring a safe and secure user experience.

With an array of features, including a dynamic product catalog and smooth payment processing through Stripe, TrendCart provides a seamless shopping experience for customers, making it the go-to destination for all their fashion needs.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
